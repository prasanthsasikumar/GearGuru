18OPERATOR SAFETY
Equipment Modifications
CFMOTO is concerned with the safety of our customers and for the general public� Therefore, we strongly
recommend that consumers do not install on a vehicle, any equipment that may increase the speed or
power of the vehicle, or make any other modifications to the vehicle for these purposes. Any modifications
to the original equipment of the vehicle create a substantial safety hazard and increase the risk of body
injury� The warranty on your vehicle is terminated if any unapproved accessory equipment has been added
to the vehicle, or if any modifications have been made to the vehicle that increase its speed or power.
Avoid Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
All engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, a deadly gas� Breathing carbon monoxide can cause
headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, confusion and eventually death�
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that may be present even if you do not see or
smell any engine exhaust� Deadly levels of carbon monoxide can collect rapidly, and you can quickly be
overcome and unable to save yourself� Also, deadly levels of carbon monoxide can linger for hours or days
in enclosed or poorly ventilated areas�
To prevent serious injury or death from carbon monoxide:
• Never run the vehicle in poorly ventilated or partially enclosed areas�
• Never run the vehicle outdoor where engine exhaust can be drawn into a building through openings
such as windows and doors�
19OPERATOR SAFETY
Avoid Gasoline Fires and Other Hazards
Gasoline is extremely flammable and highly explosive. Fuel vapors can spread and be ignited by a spark
or flame many feet away from the engine. To reduce the risk of fire or explosion, follow these instructions:
• Strictly adhere to proper fueling procedures�
• Never start or operate the engine if the fuel cap is not properly installed� Gasoline is poisonous and
can cause injury or death�
• Never siphon gasoline by mouth�
• If you swallow gasoline, get any in your eye ( s ) , or inhale gasoline vapor, see a doctor immediately.
• If gasoline spills on you, wash with soap and water and change your clothes�
Fuel Minimum Octane Rating and Safety Warnings
The recommended fuel for your vehicle is 87 octane or premium unleaded only (a maximum blend of
10% ethanol is allowed). Non-oxygenated ( ethanol-free ) fuel is recommended for best performance in all
conditions�
20OPERATOR SAFETY
WARNING
Gasoline is highly flammable and explosive under certain conditions.
Allow the engine and exhaust system to cool before filling the tank.
Always exercise extreme caution whenever handling gasoline�
Always refuel with the engine stopped, and outdoors or in a well ventilated area�
Do not smoke or allow open flames or sparks in or near the area where refueling is performed, or where
gasoline is stored�
Do not overfill the tank. Do not fill to the tank neck.
If gasoline spills on your skin or clothing, immediately wash it off with soap and water and change
clothing� Never start the engine or let it run in an enclosed area� Engine exhaust fumes are poisonous
and can cause loss of consciousness or death in a short time�
The engine exhaust from this product contains chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other
reproductive harm� Operate this vehicle only outdoors or in well-ventilated areas�
Avoid Burns from Hot Parts
The exhaust system and engine become hot during operation� Avoid contact during and shortly after
operation to avoid burns�
21OPERATOR SAFETY
Owner Responsibilities
Be Qualified and Responsible
Read this Owner’s Manual and the warning decals on this vehicle carefully� Take a safety training course
on open areas if available� Practice at low speeds� Higher speeds require greater experience, knowledge
and suitable riding conditions� Become completely familiar with the operational controls and the general
operation of the vehicle�
This vehicle is an ADULT VEHICLE ONLY� The operator must acquire a driving license as required by local
laws and regulations� Operators must be tall enough with physical capacity to: be properly seated, hold the
handlebar with both hands, fully stroke the clutch lever with the left hand, fully stroke the brake lever with
the right hand, fully stroke the foot brake lever with the right foot, be able to firmly plant both feet on the
foot pegs, and be able to balance the vehicle with the feet when stopped�
Carrying a Passenger
• The operator must acquire a driving license as required by local laws and regulations for models
equipped to carry passengers�
• Only carry one passenger� The passenger must be properly seated in the passenger seat� The
passenger should be tall enough to always be properly seated when holding handhold, and feet
firmly planted on the foot pegs.
• Instruct the passenger to read the vehicle’s safety labels�
• Never carry a passenger who has used drugs or alcohol, or is tired or ill� These slow reaction time
and impair judgment�
• Never carry a passenger if you judge their ability or judgment is insufficient to concentrate on the
terrain conditions and adapt accordingly�
22OPERATOR SAFETY
Safe Riding Gear
Always wear clothing suited to the type of riding for the driver and
passenger, includes:
1 An approved helmet
1
2 Eye protection�
3 Gloves
4 Long sleeve shirts or jackets
5 Long pants
2
6 Over-the-ankle boots
According to the actual weather, you may need extra apparel, such
as anti-fog eye protection, thermal underwear and a face guard
for cold weather� The operator must never wear loose clothing that
3 4
may get entangled in the vehicle or on tree branches and shrubs�
5
Helmet and Eye Protection
An approved helmet can prevent a serious head injury if an
accident occurs� Please note that even the best helmet is no
guarantee against injury�
6
The helmet you choose should meet the standard for your country
or area� A closed-face helmet with face shield will be better at
preventing impacts from insects, flying rocks, dust and scattered
debris, etc�
23OPERATOR SAFETY
An open-face helmet cannot offer the same protection for your face and jaw. Please wear detachable face
masks and goggles when wearing an open-face helmet�
Do not depend on eyeglasses or sunglasses for eye protection, as they are not rated for impact protection�
Debris may fly up and or break the lens, causing eye injury.
Use tinted masks or goggles only during the day in bright light, do not use them at night or in poor light�
They may affect your ability to distinguish colors. Do not use them if your color discrimination is affected.
Gloves
Full-finger gloves could protect your hands from wind, sun, heat, cold, and splash. Well-fitted gloves are
helpful for steering and relieve hand fatigue. If the gloves are too heavy, it will be difficult to operate the
vehicle�
A pair of strong motorcycle gloves offer protection for your hands in the event of an accident or turnover.
Snowmobile gloves offer better protection when operating in cold areas.
Jackets, Pants and Motorcycle Suits
Wear a jacket or a long sleeved shirt and long pants, or a full riding suit� Quality protective gear will provide
comfort, and it can help you avoid being distracted by adverse environmental elements� In case of an
accident, good quality protective gear made of sturdy material may prevent or reduce injury�
In cool-weather riding, protect yourself against hypothermia� Hypothermia, a condition of low body
temperature, can cause loss of concentration, slowed reactions and loss of smooth, precise muscle
movement� In cool conditions, proper protective gear like a windproof jacket and insulated layers of
clothing are essential� Even while riding at moderate temperatures, you can feel very cold due to the wind�
Protective gear that is appropriate for cold-weather riding may be too hot when stopped� Dress in layers
so that clothing can be removed as desired� Topping the protective gear with a windproof outer layer can
prevent cold air from reaching the skin�
24OPERATOR SAFETY
Boots
Always wear closed-toe, over-the-ankle boots. Sturdy over-the-ankle boots with non-slip soles offer more
protection, and allow you to plant your foot properly on the foot pegs� Avoid long shoelaces that could get
tangled in the vehicle components� For winter riding conditions, rubber-soled boots with either nylon or
leather uppers and removable felt liners are best suited� Avoid rubber rain boots� Rubber rain boots may
get trapped behind the foot brake pedal, impairing proper operation�
Other Riding Gear
Rain Gear
When riding in rainy weather, a rain suit or a waterproof riding suit is recommended� On long rides, it is a
good idea to carry rain gear� Keeping clothes dry results in being much more comfortable and alert�
Hearing Protection
Long-term exposure to wind and engine noise when riding can cause permanent hearing loss� Properly
worn hearing protective devices such as earplugs can help prevent hearing loss� Check local laws before
using any hearing protective devices�
25OPERATOR SAFETY

82SAFETY OPERATION
Safety Operation
Safe Riding Technique
The following cautions are applicable for daily motorcycle use and should be carefully observed for safe
and effective vehicle operation:
• For safety, eye protection and a helmet are strongly recommended� You must be aware of safety
regulations prior to riding the motorcycle� Gloves and suitable footwear should also be used for
added protection�
• Wear protective apparel when riding in case of any collision� Protective apparel cannot protect the
body safely if it is not worn�
• Before changing lanes, look over your shoulder to make sure the way is safe� Do not rely solely on
the rearview mirrors� You may misjudge a vehicle’s distance and speed, which can easily cause an
accident�
• When going up steep slopes, shift to a lower gear so there’s plenty of power and engine torque
rather than overloading the engine�
• When applying the brakes, apply both the front and rear brakes at the same time� Applying only one
brake for sudden braking may cause the motorcycle to skid and lose control�
• When going down long downhill slopes, control vehicle speed by releasing the throttle� Use the front
and rear brakes for auxiliary braking�
• In wet conditions, rely more on the throttle to control vehicle speed and less on the front and rear
brakes� The throttle should also be used judiciously to avoid skidding the rear wheel during rapid
acceleration or deceleration�
83SAFETY OPERATION
• Riding at the proper speed and avoiding unnecessary acceleration are important not only for safety
and low fuel consumption, but also for longer vehicle life and quieter operation�
• When riding in wet conditions or on loose roadway surfaces, vehicle performance will be reduced�
All of your actions should be smooth under these conditions� Sudden acceleration, braking or
turning may cause loss of control�
• Practice your operating skills� In an empty area, exercise cautiously, slow down, and grip the fuel
tank with the knees for better stability� When quick acceleration is necessary as in passing, shift to a
lower gear to obtain the necessary power�
• Do not downshift at high rpm to avoid damage to the engine�
• Avoid unnecessary use of fabric tape which may entangle the rider or motorcycle�
84SAFETY OPERATION
Additional Cautions for High Speed Operation
Brakes: Braking is very important, especially during high speed operation� It cannot be over-forced� Check
and replace pads more often to get better performance�
Handling: Looseness in the handling parts may cause loss of control� Check to see whether the handlebar
turns freely but has no shaking, and that the wheels turn without shaking or looseness�
Tires: High speed operation requires that tires be in good condition� Good condition tires are crucial for
riding safety. Inspect their overall condition, inflate them to the proper pressure, and check the wheel
balance�
Fuel: Have sufficient fuel onboard for high speed operation.
Engine oil: To avoid engine failure which could result in a loss of control, make sure the oil level is
maintained between the upper and lower level lines�
Coolant: To avoid overheating, check and make sure that the coolant level is between the level lines�
Electrical Equipment: Make sure that the headlights, tail/brake light, turn signals, horn and etc� work
properly�
Fasteners: Make sure that all nuts and bolts are tight and that all safety-related parts are in good condition�
DANGER
Follow all traffic regulations� Do not ride on the highway over posted speed limits� Riding at too high
speed on the highway will violate related regulations� Motorcycles may be forbidden to operate on the
highway in some areas�
85MAINTENANCE
Maintenance
Careful periodic maintenance will help keep your vehicle in the safest, most reliable condition� Inspection,
adjustment, and lubrication of important components are explained in the maintenance schedule�
Inspect, clean, lubricate, adjust, and replace parts as necessary� When inspection reveals the need for
replacement parts, always use genuine parts available from your dealer�
NOTE:
Periodic service and adjustments are critical� If you are not familiar with performing safe service and
adjustment procedures, have a qualified dealer perform the required maintenance for you.
Pay special attention to the engine oil level during cold weather operation� A rise in engine oil level can
indicate contaminants collecting in the oil sump or crankcase� Change oil immediately if the oil level begins
to rise� Monitor the oil level, and if it continues to rise, discontinue use and determine the cause, or see
your dealer�
Severe Use Definition
CFMOTO defines severe vehicle use as:
• Racing or race-style high RPM use
• Prolonged low speed, heavy load operation
• Extended engine idle
• Short trip cold weather operation
• Vehicles used in commercial or rental operations
If your vehicle use matches any of these definitions, decrease the service intervals by 50%.
86MAINTENANCE
Key Points of Lubrication Schedule:
Check all components at the intervals outlined in the Periodic Maintenance Schedule� Items not listed in
the schedule should be lubricated at the general lubrication interval�
• Change lubricants more often under severe use, such as wet or dusty conditions�
• Lubricate before long periods of storage, after pressure washing, or after submerging drive system�

Air Intake and Exhaust System
Fuel & Exhaust Detecting System
Fuel & exhaust system optimization is detected by oxygen
sensors 1 � An oxygen sensor installed on each exhaust pipe
detects air & fuel combustion condition by measuring oxygen
density and transferring it as an electrical signal to the ECU� If
1
the ECU determines that combustion is not optimal, it will make
adjustments to fuel injection in accordance with signals from the
TPS and Intake Air Temperature sensors� By this way, the ratio
of air against fuel can be optimized for complete combustion�
Air Intake Valve
An air intake valve is essentially a valve which allows fresh air to flow only from the air filter into the
engine� Any air that passes through the air intake valve is prevented from returning� Have a dealer inspect
the air intake valves in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart� Also, have the air intake valves
inspected whenever stable idling cannot be obtained, engine power is greatly reduced, or there are
abnormal engine noises�
Air intake valve removal and inspection should only be performed by an authorized CFMOTO dealer�
106MAINTENANCE
Valve Clearance
The engine valves and valve seats wear during operation� Adjustment of the valvetrain components should
be performed by a dealer technician in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart�
WARNING
If adjustment of the valve clearance is not performed, it will eventually result in no clearance or cause the
valves remaining partly open, which reduces performance, creates valve noise, and can cause serious
engine damage� Valve clearance for each valve should be checked and adjusted in accordance with the
Periodic Maintenance Chart� Inspection and adjustment should be performed by a CFMOTO dealer�
107MAINTENANCE
Air Filter
A clogged air filter restricts air flow, increases fuel consumption,
reduces engine power, and causes spark plug fouling� The
air filter element must be cleaned in accordance with the
periodic Maintenance Chart� When driving in dusty, rainy, or
muddy conditions, the air filter element should be serviced
1
more frequently than the recommended interval in the periodic
Maintenance Chart. Due to the vehicle’s design, air filter service
should be only performed by an authorized dealer�
Indicator hose 1 alerts to excessive dirt, residual oil or water in
the air filter.
CAUTION
Oil on tires and plastic or other parts will cause damage�
If engine intakes with the unfiltered air, will have a negative effect on the service life of the engine.
Never start to use the vehicle without an air filter.
108MAINTENANCE
Cooling System
Radiator and Cooling Fan
Check the radiator fins for bending, out of shape, obstruction by insects or mud, and clean off any
obstructions with a stream of low pressure water�
WARNING
Keep your hands and clothing away from the fan blades when it is working to avoid any injury�
Using high-pressure water to wash the vehicle could damage the radiator fins and impair the radiator's
effectiveness. Installing unauthorized accessories in front of the radiator or behind the cooling fan may
cause interference with the radiator airflow, and can lead to overheating and consequent engine damage.
If the radiator fins are damaged by more than 20% of their surface area by obstructions, and it is unable
to be cleared, then replace with new radiator�
Radiator Hoses
Check the radiator hoses for leaks, cracks, deterioration, rust, corrosion and connections for leaks or
looseness daily before riding the motorcycle� Check in accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart�
109MAINTENANCE
Coolant
Coolant absorbs excessive heat from the engine and transfers it to the air by the radiator� If the coolant
level is low, the engine will overheat and may suffer severe damage. Check the coolant level daily before
riding the motorcycle and perform maintenance in accordance with the periodic maintenance chart�
Replenish coolant if the level is low�
To protect the cooling system (engine and radiator contain aluminum parts) from rust and corrosion,
the use of corrosion and rust inhibitor chemicals in the coolant is essential� Purchase only commercially
available coolant that contains corrosion and rust inhibitor chemicals, so there is no need to add
separately�
110MAINTENANCE
DANGER
Coolant is toxic and harmful for health�
Do not allow the coolant to touch skin, eyes or clothing�
If coolant is swallowed, see a doctor immediately�
If coolant contacts the skin, flush the contact position with plenty of water immediately.
If coolant contacts the eyes, flush the eyes with plenty of water and see a doctor immediately.
If coolant splashes on clothes, change the clothes�
Any corrosion or rust flushed from the engine and radiator should be disposed of following special
instructions� The chemicals inside are harmful to the human body�
CAUTION
Do not add tap water to the coolant system� It will cause deposit accumulation inside the cooling system�
Use only distilled water and coolant 50% \ 50% mix� When temperatures are below 0°C, improper water/
coolant mix can cause freezing, severe interference, and failure of the coolant system�
Available bottled antifreeze on the market contains anti-corrosion and anti-rust properties� When it is
diluted excessively, it loses its anti-corrosion and anti-rust performance� Keep the diluted concentration of
antifreeze the same as the instructions from the manufacturer�
When filling the cooling system, ensure the coolant color is green and contains ethylene glycol. When the
environment temperature is below 32˚F (0˚C), please ensure the coolant has a freezing point below 32˚F
(0˚C).
111MAINTENANCE
Coolant Level Inspection
Support the vehicle vertically on a level surface�
Inspect the coolant level in the reservoir�
If the level is within area ‘B,’ the coolant is at the proper level.
If the level is within area ‘A,’ drain out the excess coolant until the A
level is within area ‘B’.
B
If the level is within area ‘C’ or you cannot see the level, add the
same coolant until the level is within area ‘B’.
C
WARNING
When the vehicle is running, the coolant will have a very high temperature and stay in a state of
compression�
Before the engine or cooling system has cooled down, do not open the radiator, radiator hose, reservoir
or other cooling system related parts�
In the event of scalding, wash the affected area immediately with running water for more than 10 minutes
and seek medical attention�
112MAINTENANCE
Coolant Filling
Open the reservoir cover and add coolant to area B�
CAUTION
If coolant needs to be added frequently, or the reservoir tank is completely dry, there is probably a leak in
the system� Have the cooling system inspected by an authorized dealer�
Contact your dealer for replacing coolant. Mixing different coolant may lead to engine damage.
113MAINTENANCE
Tire and Chain
This vehicle only uses tubeless tires, rims and inflating valves. Only use the recommended standard tires,
rims and inflating valves. Do not install inner tube tires on tubeless rims. Do not install a inner tube inside a
tubeless tire� If tires are not installed properly, it may cause tire air leakage�

Improper tire pressure or exceeding the tire load limit may affect the vehicle handling and performance,
causing a loss of control�
Make periodic inspections of the tire air pressure using a tire pressure gauge� Adjust tire pressure
accordingly�
Excessive low tire pressure may cause tire improper wear or overheating�
Proper tire pressure offers the best comfort level and the longest service life.
114MAINTENANCE
NOTE:
Inspect the tire pressure when the tires are cold�
Tire pressure is affected by the change of environment temperature and altitude� If the environment
temperature and altitude have a big change during the driving trip, tire pressure should be adjusted and
inspected accordingly�
Most countries have their own regulation for minimum tread depth� Please follow local regulations� When
installing new rims or tires, always inspect for wheel balance�
CAUTION
In order to keep the handling safety and stability, please only use the tire and pressure recommended�
If the tire is punctured and repaired or used within 24 hours after repairing, the vehicle speed should not
exceed 60km/h, and cannot exceed 90 km/h at any other time� A punctured tire should be repaired as
soon as possible�
The front and rear tires should come from the same manufacturer, with the same tread pattern�
New tires can be slippery and may cause a loss of control and injury if proper break-in is not performed�
Please drive the vehicle at moderate speeds using different tilt angles to have the tires create friction with
the ground over the entire surface area� Normal friction surface will be formed after a 160km break-in
period� Avoid sudden braking, heavy acceleration, and high speed sharp turns during the break-in period�
Tire Payload
The maximum recommended payload is: 330�7 lb (150 kg), including driver, luggage / cargo and
accessories�
115MAINTENANCE
Tire Friction
When tire tread wear exceeds the use limit, the tire becomes more susceptible to punctures and failure�
An accepted estimate is that 90% of all tire failures occur during the last 10% of tread life, so it is unsafe to
continue to use tires until they are bald� In accordance with the Periodic Maintenance Chart, measure the
depth of the tread with a depth gauge, and replace any tire that has worn down to the minimum allowable
tread depth�
Visually inspect the tire tread for cracks and cuts, and replace with a new tire if severely damaged� For
example, if partial expansion appears on the tire, it means the tire is severely damaged�
Remove any embedded stones or other foreign particles form the tread�
CAUTION

Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
ABS is a safety system that prevents locking of the wheels when driving straight ahead without the
influence of lateral forces.
With assistant of ABS, when fully brake or brake in gritty, ponding, sliding or other low adhesive force road
conditions, all could handle with full brake force and will not lock the wheel which could be dangerous�
DANGER
It is not always possible to prevent vehicle rollover in extreme riding situations, e�g� luggage loaded with
a high center of gravity, varying road surfaced, steep descents, full braking without clutch lever released�
Adapt your riding style to the road conditions and your driving ability�
ABS operates with two independent brake circuits (front and rear brakes)� When the brake electronics
control unit detects a locking tendency in a wheel, ABS begins regulating the brake pressure� We can feel
the regulating process according to the slight pulsing of the hand or foot brake levers�
Turn on the ignition switch, ABS indicator should light up and go out after starting off. If ABS indicator will
not go out after starting off, or if it lights up during driving, this indicates that there is a fault in the ABS
system� In this case, ABS will not work, the wheels may lock during braking� The brake system still stays
functional, only ABS is not available�

Electrical System and Light Signal
Battery
The battery in this vehicle is a maintenance-free battery� Therefore, it is unnecessary to inspect the
amount of battery electrolyte or add distilled water� To ensure optimum service life of the battery, keep the
battery charged properly to ensure the battery has reserve capacity available at the starter motor� When
the motorcycle is used frequently, battery is charged by the motorcycle charging system� If the motorcycle
is only used occasionally, or used for a short time during each ride, the battery can remain discharged�
Batteries can also self-discharge from infrequent use� The rate of discharge varies with battery type and
ambient temperature� When environment temperature rises for example, the rate of discharge could
increase by a factor of 1 for every 15°C temperature rise�
In cold weather, if battery is not charged properly it can easily cause freeze the electrolyte, which may lead
to battery cracking and warp electrode plates out of shape� Proper, full charging of the battery improves
freeze-proof capability�

136MAINTENANCE
Catalytic Converter
This motorcycle is equipped with a catalytic converter in the exhaust system� Platinum and rhodium
contained inside the converter reacts with the engine exhaust of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons
to convert them into carbon dioxide and water, resulting in cleaner exhaust gases discharged into the
atmosphere�
For proper operation of the catalytic converter, the following cautions must be followed:
Only use unleaded gasoline. Never use leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline significantly reduces the service
life of the catalytic converter�
Do not coast the vehicle with the engine and transmission engaged, and the ignition switch and/or engine
stop switch off� Do not attempt to start the engine many times when the battery is discharged� Under
these conditions, unburned air/fuel mixture can flow into exhaust system, accelerating the reaction with
the converter which leads the converter to become overheated and damaged when the engine is hot, or
reduce converter performance when the engine is cold�
CAUTION
Only use unleaded gasoline� Even only a little lead can damage the precious metals inside the catalytic
converter, causing catalytic converter failure. Do not add anti-rust oil or engine oil into the muffler, which
may result in catalytic converter failure�
137MAINTENANCE
Fuel Evaporation System
This vehicle is equipped with an EVAP System� Fuel vapors from the fuel tank are drawn into a carbon
tank through an absorption tube� The fuel vapors are absorbed by canister that contains active carbon
when the engine is stopped. When the engine is running, fuel vapors absorbed in the carbon canister flow
into the air intake and burn as a normal part of combustion, avoiding environmental pollution instead of
being released into the air directly� Meanwhile, air pressure inside the fuel tank is balanced by the EVAP
system� If inner pressure of fuel tank is lower than outside, it is available to replenish air pressure through
the air tube of the carbon canister and absorption tube� The EVAP tube system should always remain clear
without blocking or squeezing, otherwise the fuel pump could be damaged, and the fuel tank can also
become deformed or broken�
Please contact CFMOTO dealer if a fuel evaporation system component has failed� Do not modify the
fuel evaporation system, or the system will not meet requirements for environmental regulations� Tube
connections should be well connected after any repair without air leakage, blocking, squeezing, being
broken or damaged etc�
